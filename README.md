INTELLIGENT TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION SYSTEM

The objective of this project is to reduce the problems posed by the daily traffic in peopleâ€™s lives. 
The project aims to recommend the best time to travel to a given destination to minimize the commute time. This in turn tries to reduce the problems faced by travelers in the city, and improvise the traffic conditions of the city.
